Operations Assistant (Temp) 
Location: Greater Boston Area
Position is available: Immediately
WHO WE ARE
Every student deserves opportunities in life, and every educator committed to providing those opportunities, deserves support. Those beliefs drive us to work alongside schools to support great teaching so that we can work towards guaranteeing that all students are receiving high quality instruction. We partner with over 900 schools - both district and charter - in underserved communities around the country, thus impacting more than 330,000 students. Third-party evaluations confirm that when schools have the right basic conditions in place and partner with ANet, they achieve 6-8 months of additional learning over a two-year period compared to schools not partnering with ANet. 
 
At ANet we are committed to living out our core values, both across our organization and with our partner schools. We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work. We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so, we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.
 
Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having an impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together.

Troubleshoot issues that arise within daily work
Provide real-time support to internal team members through updating and leveraging student information, student data and other online resources
Partner closely with others on the Support & Operations Team to support the evolution of our internal processes and systems
WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU BRING
In order to be successful in this role, candidates must demonstrate the following:
You bring exceptional attention to detail, prioritization, and strong organizational skills.
You are energized by working in an entrepreneurial, fast-paced, highly collaborative, and team-oriented environment.
You understand that schools are dynamic places and are comfortable working on projects and tasks with shifting priorities.
You get excited about supporting others to do their best work and consistently go above and beyond in meeting the needs of your team and external partners.
You have a passionate commitment to and sense of urgency for the support of schools and believe that all students can achieve at high levels.

You are eager to examine personal archetypes and biases while discussing topics related to race, class, and privilege which relate to ANet's Advance Equity and People Matter values, and our work towards becoming an anti-racist organization.
WHAT WE OFFER

The Old North Foundation (ONF) seeks a dynamic, visionary, and innovative leader to serve as its next Executive Director. Located in Boston‚Äôs Historic North End, Old North Foundation‚Äôs mission is to promote the visibility and preservation of the Old North Church‚Äôs historical role in the birth of our nation. ONF is a secular non-profit organization that promotes the values of freedom, liberty and civic engagement through the interpretation and preservation of Old North Church and Historic Site, an enduring symbol of American independence.

The Organization

The enduring fame of Old North began on the evening of April 18, 1775, when the church sexton Robert Newman and Vestryman Capt. John Pulling, Jr. climbed the steeple of Old North Church and held high two lanterns as a signal to Paul Revere that the British were marching to Lexington and Concord by sea across the Charles River and not by land. This fateful event ignited the American Revolution.  Old North Church is Boston‚Äôs oldest surviving church building and welcomes a quarter of a million visitors each year as one of the Freedom Trail‚Äôs most visited historical sites. The Old North Church & Historic Site also include:
‚Ä¢	The 1715 Clough House, one of Boston‚Äôs oldest surviving brick residences, houses the historic chocolate program at Old North Church & Historic Site.
‚Ä¢	A chapel built in 1918 for Italian immigrants, which now serves as the Old North Gift Shop.
‚Ä¢	Three large courtyards, two formal gardens, and a war memorial to soldiers fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan.
‚Ä¢	Two adjoining townhouses converted into use for administrative, educational, social, civic, and parish programs.
ONF was established in 1991 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization independent of Christ Church in the City of Boston. In January 2004, all operational responsibility for historic site operations and for interpretative, educational, and preservation programs were transferred from Christ Church to the Foundation. Christ Church is an active Episcopal Church and partners with Old North Foundation to support the site. ONF works daily to:
‚Ä¢	Manage the utilization and preservation of the Old North, its buildings and campus.  Its archive is maintained in partnership with the Massachusetts Historical Society.
‚Ä¢	Foster educational and interpretative programs for students and visitors.
‚Ä¢	Engage the public in the Old North‚Äôs history and its role in inspiring liberty and freedom through visitation, exhibits in its rotating gallery space, discussion groups, a history blog, and active use of its website and social media.
‚Ä¢	Enhance interest in and exploration of the historic site through the accurate portrayal of the issues of the Colonial era, through a historical and contemporary lens.


The Position

The Executive Director reports to the Board of Directors and leads the development and implementation of initiatives and programs that broaden the visibility and support of Old North Church and its historical significance. The Executive Director is a relationship builder, an ambassador, and a fund raiser for Old North.  The Executive Director is responsible for the financial management, interpretation, preservation, maintenance and sustainability of the historic site as an educational resource to visitors and as an historical tourist destination. 

The successful candidate for this position will have a history of success with an organization leading fund development, fiscal management, staff leadership, acuity, and marketing and creative talents. S/he will bring professional experience to lead the organization through a fresh strategic planning process that will set the stage for ONF for years to come.

Qualifications Needed

‚Ä¢	Ability to serve as the public spokesperson and collaborate with local historical sites/organizations to enhance local and national interest in Old North Church, the Boston Freedom Trail, Boston tourism and history more broadly.
‚Ä¢	Proven fundraising leadership record for campaigns and capital projects.  Must be comfortable sharing the Old North story and building a robust development effort for the organization.
‚Ä¢	Experience with all facets of fund development for operations, programs, and capital projects from a wide variety of public, corporate, and individual sources.
‚Ä¢	Demonstrated record as an effective manager and team builder with experience hiring, promoting, and managing a talented professional staff and cohort of committed volunteers.
‚Ä¢	  Experience working with an active and engaged Board of Directors. Ability to assist in the selection, evaluation, and orientation of new Board members.
‚Ä¢	Oversight of annual and multiyear budgets. Ability to work in partnership with the Board to develop, review, and update the organization‚Äôs strategic plan and associated revenue streams.
‚Ä¢	Capacity to serve as a bridge builder and partner with Christ Church in the City of Boston, and with community organizations, to communicate the site‚Äôs vision and values for students, local businesses and community leaders, visitors, historians, and anthropologists.

Characteristics Desired

‚Ä¢	A passion and enthusiasm for US history.
‚Ä¢	Enthusiastic and skilled cultivator and steward of prospect and donor relationships.
‚Ä¢	Embraces change, takes initiative and shapes organizational direction.
‚Ä¢	Superior organizational and interpersonal skills including ability to work cooperatively with Board members, donors, staff, partners, and volunteers.
